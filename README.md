# Tong's Summer of Code

Tong has decided to code every day from May to August, 2017. All resources, covering various subjects, will be committed to this repo, and hope you could find some of them useful.

## Contents

- [`iam_stats/`](iam_stats/): use Python 3 to produce statistics about the IAM Online Handwriting Dataset.
- [`poj/`](poj/): solve ACM problems on [Peking University Online Judge](http://poj.org/).
- [`acm/`](acm/): solve ACM problems used in previous ICPC programming contests.

**Note**: POJ is currently down for unknown reasons. I'm trying to find alternative sources for ACM problems, but they may be somewhat inconsistent. 

## Commit Timeline

- May 12th: repository init
- May 13th: IAM Handwriting Dataset Statistics
- May 14th: complete POJ problem [\#1021](poj/1021.cpp)
- May 15th: complete ACM world final 2007 Problem A
